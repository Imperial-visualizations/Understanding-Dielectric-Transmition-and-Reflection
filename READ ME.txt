Wave and Dielectrics:

The aim of the suite is to visualisation the propagation of waves through dielectric boundries, starting with basic concepts
that the student should be comfortable with already and working up to the last lecture of the second year EM course that introduces
Evanescent waves.

Single Wave:

This visulisation was created to replace an almost identical visulisation but instead of using a JSON file the waves are 
created in real time. The code was translated from the python used to create the original JSON file.

Plane Wave:

This aims to show how the "ray" view of snell's law is not quite complete and must be seen as part of a larger plane wave 
incident on the boundry. The surface plot within plotly requires a square matrix for the z-axis, hence sine waves along a 
specific y-axis value are created with the wavelength of these determined by the angle of incidence/reflection/refraction.
This visulisation doesn't include any new physics versus the Single Wave visulisation.

Evanescent Waves:

This demonstrates how even beyond the critical angle, some wave propagates into the second material, but with an exponential
decay and only moves along the boundry line, not perpendicular to it. This visulisation could be moved to the Attenuation suite
due to the dependance on angular frequency for the strength of the exponential decay of the evanescent waves.

To do:
1. clean up the current visulisation and decide which should stay/go as there are too many
2. Revise the physics 
3. More sliders?? amplitude of waves etc
4. Plane waves only show oscilisations prependicular to plane of incidence, need a visulisation for oscillations parallel
though I am not sure what that would look like.
